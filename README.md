# dotsAndConfs

This reposository has some config files of my own and some dotfiles that I do to make my daily life easier.

## CONKY
Conky configuration executes hddtemp without sudo, but before to execute it's necessary to run the following command: 
```
sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp
``` 
This allows conky works properly with hddtemp

## VIM
Vim has only a configuration and not the plugins to use it
